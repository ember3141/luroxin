        <p>I had searched long and hard for some kind of planner tool that allows you to block off time in a flexible
            way, but in the end, I had to create it myself.<br />Each time I arrive home from school or work, I am given
            a chunk of time I must ration. However, with my many activities and responsibilities, it is difficult to
            simply have an hourly schedule to follow. Who knows how long dinner may take, or if something unexpected
            comes up. Hourly planners do not account for the realities of life and give me the flexibility I
            need.<br />Out of frustration, I made my own program to do this. Check it out at the link below.</p>

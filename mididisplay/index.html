Part of the competition is creating a booth for your buisness.</p><br><p>He asked me one day if I could make something interactive for his buisness. His guidelines were exactly as follows. Since his buisness is music related, he wanted a piano that when notes were pressed, somehow a message would appear. He wanted to display certain values about his buisness.</p><br><p>Immediately as he was telling me this, I thought of like 15 different ideas. I thought about having a microcontroller with a mic that senses pitch, and prints out a message based on which pitch it hears, I thought about a 3d printed touch keyboard that would light up a sign with the coorosponding message. Ultimently, after conveying all my ideas to him, he settled on a midi keyboard that attaches to a computer program that graphically flashes messages on the screen.</p><br><p>Since his booth was a single table, I was worried about taking up too much space. I went to several thrift stores in hopes of finding a midi controller small enough, I was worried if I didn't find anything I'd have to order something like an Akai mini online, which could take days to ship.<br>Fortunently, at the last thrift store I visited, a bright blue mini piano was just sitting in the electronics section. I couldn't ask for anything better since the colorscheme of the competition was also blue.</p><img src="media/sudio49.jpg" alt="the blue keyboard itself" class="project-banner"><h6 style="color:grey">credit: https://www.kupujemprodajem.com/muzicki-instrumenti/midi-kontroleri/studio-49-midi-klavijatura-adapter/oglas/138239635</h6><br><p>One of my favorite simple graphics libraries for quickly drafting interactive visuals is p5js. Since I was under a tight time constraint, I quickly wrote the program for the web browser. I used webmidi to read the midi controller from the web.</p><video width="864" height="530" controls style="align-self:center"><source src="media/pianodemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>As I finished the project the day before my friend would be flying out to another state to compete in DECA, I got a message from him:</p><br><p>I soon learned that he would not have any access to power outlets. Within a few hours before his flight, I jerryrigged together several D sized batterys in a paper towel tube and ripped apart an old power cable. Fortunently, TSA did not detain him for having something that looks like the spitting image of a bomb.</p><div class="image-row"><img src="media/susbattery.jpg" alt="suspicious battery" style="width:30%" class="project-banner"> <img src="media/suspiciousbattery.jpg" alt="suspicious battery" style="width:30%" class="project-banner"></div><h6 style="color:grey">yes, that tube with the medicine bottles and loose wire is the battery</h6><br><p>In the end, it worked great and I'm glad my last minute project survived the trip.</p><a href=".." class="logo-link-bottom"><img src="/src/media/luroxin fog.jpg" alt="Luroxin Home"></a></div></body></html>

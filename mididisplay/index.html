        <h1>Piano to Message</h1>

        <div class="project-meta">
            <strong>Date:</strong> 2025 &nbsp; <strong>Status: </strong>Completed
        </div>
        <p>My friend competes in DECA, which is a business competition. Part of the competition involves creating a booth to pitch the business you develop.</p>
        <br />
        <p>One day he asked me if I could create something interactive for his business. His guidelines to me were exactly as follows:
            since his business is music related, he wanted a piano that when keys were pressed, somehow a message would appear.
            He wanted to display certain core values about his business. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p> Immediately as he was telling me this, I thought of somewhere between 10 to 15 different ideas. I thought about having a microcontroller
            with a mic that senses pitch, and prints out a message based on which pitch it hears; I considered having 
            a 3D-printed touch keyboard that would light up a sign with the corrosponding message. Ultimately, after 
            conveying all my ideas to him, he settled on a midi keyboard that attaches to a computer program that 
            graphically flashes messages on the screen.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Since his booth was a single table, I was worried about taking up too much space. I went to several thrift stores
            in hopes of finding a midi controller small enough. I was worried if I didn't find anything I'd have to order something like
            an Akai Mini, which could take days to ship. 
            
           <br /> 
            Fortunately, at the last thrift store I visited, a bright blue mini piano 
            was just sitting in the electronics section. I couldn't ask for anything better since the color scheme of the competition was also blue.

        <p>One of my favorite simple graphics libraries for quickly drafting interactive visuals is p5js. Since I was under a tight
            time constraint, I quickly wrote the program for the web browser. I used webmidi to read the midi controller from the web.

            As I finished the project the day before my friend would be flying out to another state to compete in DECA, I got a message from
            him:
        </p>
        <img src="media/power.jpg" alt="Friend: does it need constant power?" style="width:30%"
                class="project-banner" />

        <p>
            I learned that he would not have access to power outlets. Within a few hours before his flight, I jerry-rigged
            several D-sized batteries together in a paper towel tube and ripped apart an old power cable. Fortunately, TSA did not detain him for 
            having something that could have been mistaken for a bomb.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h6 style="color:grey;">yes, that tube with the medicine bottles and loose wire is the battery</h6>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, it worked great and I'm glad my last minute project survived the trip. </p>

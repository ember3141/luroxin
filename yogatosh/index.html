        <p>I will be posting my full conversion process soon.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This Lenovo Yoga has such a premium feel. Holding it makes me think of when <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvfrVrh76Mk">Steve Jobs introduced the Macbook Air.</a></p>
        <p>The fact that it folds into a completely flat rectangle when closed, makes it look and feel satisfying. The
            bevels on the original Macbook Air were added to give the illusion of a thinner device. I think that's
            excessive and I enjoy this simpler design better. And additionally, the fact that it is made of pure brushed
            aluminum, including all the keyboard keys, really is the cherry on top.
        </p>
        <p>
            Otherwise, I think it's a complete practical design failure. The hinges are designed with critical points in
            the most vulnerable spots. A small bump completely knocks off the hinge cover. The internal power switch
            plastic turns brittle after 4 years and will snap off, essentially bricking the laptop to the
            technically-challenged consumer. The heat management is atrocious. This laptop is, in short, a nightmare for
            a typical user.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mainly leave this device at home, running a Bluebubbles server. It allows me to send and receive iMessages
            on my Android Phone.
        </p>

            If you wish to attempt something similar, there are many different Hackintosh Guides out there.
            I had to experiment with the kexts as new updates bring new incompatibilities. In the future I will document
            all of the
            non standard decisions I had to make when setting up this Hackintosh. It probably took me about a week to
            get all the
            features working such as wifi and touchscreen.
